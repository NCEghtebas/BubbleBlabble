Bblob

Summary:

Bblob is a 2D ear-training game built in Unity with C#. It can be played with a MIDI controller, computer keyboard, or the Seaboard, a radically new new musical instrument with polyphone pitch blend, vibrato, and pre-note dynamic changes.

The objective of the game is to grow your Bblob by acquiring smaller blobs by imitating musical motifs. Perfect for jazz musicians (or any musician) looking to improve their skill set.
